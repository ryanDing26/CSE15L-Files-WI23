## Different Ways to Use Grep  
There are many ways for us to use grep, from the ways with which Professor Politz taught us in lecture to other ways that can be found online.  
### 1. Searching for a specific string within a file 
#### 
### 2. Counting the number of files with a given search query  

### 3. Searching files that do NOT match a pattern  

### 4. Recursively searching through multiple directories
