 # Hello, world! I am Ryan Ding, a student in Professor Joe Politz's CSE 15L class Winter Quarter 2023! This is a Heading 1!
[Lab Report 1] TBA
_Italics use one underscore at the beginning and end of the phrase you want to italicize_
__Bolding is similar, but two underscores are used__
*Italics* and **Bold** underscores can also use the * symbol instead of the underscores!
## This is a Heading 2; Each heading uses the pound symbol to denote a heading; The more pound symbols, the smaller the heading!
