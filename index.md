 # Hello, world! I am Ryan Ding, a student in Professor Joe Politz's CSE 15L class Winter Quarter 2023! This is a Heading 1!  
[Lab Report 1](https://ryanding26.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/labReport1.html) [Other page I made that has nothing on it](https://ryanding26.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/newPage.html)

_Italics use one underscore at the beginning and end of the phrase you want to italicize_  
__Bolding is similar, but two underscores are used__  
*Italics* and **Bold** underscores can also use the star -> * symbol instead of the underscores!  
## This is a Heading 2; Each heading uses the pound symbol to denote a heading; The more pound symbols, the smaller the heading!
> "The '>' arrow denotes a blockquote. Pretend I am saying something really profound" -Ryan Ding
